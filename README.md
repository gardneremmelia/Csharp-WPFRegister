# Csharp-WPFRegister
# WPF Register Student Software Requirements List
1. The program uses the following assumptions:
- Each course carries three credit hours. 
- The program terminates only when the student requires it.
2. The program must follow these registration business rules: 
- No registration more than once for the same course
- No registration for more than nine credit hours (e.g., no more than three courses)
3. The program validates the user menu selection. If the selection is valid, the program registers the student for the selected course. Otherwise, the program outputs an error message. The program then outputs the current list of registered classes. The program should also output the cumulative total credit hours the student has registered for so far.
